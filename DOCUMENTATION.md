## Vercel Deployment Fix - Routing Issues

### Date: January 2025

### Problem
On Vercel deployment, only the homepage was working. All other routes were redirecting to the homepage.

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by missing or incomplete Vercel configuration. The `next.config.ts` file was missing crucial routing configuration, and the `vercel.json` needed proper framework specification.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Updated `next.config.ts`
- Added `trailingSlash: false` configuration to ensure proper URL handling
- This prevents Next.js from incorrectly handling trailing slashes in routes

#### 2. Updated `vercel.json`
- Added `buildCommand: "next build"` to ensure proper build process
- Added `framework: "nextjs"` to specify the framework type
- Added `installCommand: "npm install"` for consistent install process

### Files Modified
1. `next.config.ts` - Added trailingSlash configuration
2. `vercel.json` - Added build, framework, and install commands

### Testing
After these changes, redeploy the application on Vercel to verify that all routes work correctly.
